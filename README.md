# Counter-forensic-attack-detection
### Dataset extraction from parquet files-done, instead point to parquet files
### other all other images under data folder-instead point to google drive
### image reconstruction using auto-encoder-done
### extracting CLIP encodings
### CLIP classifier training
### DCT classifier training for binary and multiclass
### trained models
### attack detection (ensemble model)
### testing dct on resized images

The test results given in the paper can be reproduced with the data given in the above link as follows:

# 9/9/24
### Done-3dct models, 3 way clip model, 3 way dct
### Left-code to test everything, 3way dct cleanup, all bin dct cleanup
